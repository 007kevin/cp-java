   *tips*
   - Read tutorial if you cannot reach solution within 15 minutes of thinking (Prob B)
   - Read tutorial if you cannot reach solution within 30 minutes of thinking (Prob C)
   - When solving problem, read code of other high-rated coders as they may have faster impl.
   - For prob C, compile on paper before coding!
